```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

const WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER_SIZE: usize = 2;
static mut WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER: [u8; WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER_SIZE] = [0; WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER_SIZE];
```

- **use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;**: Imports necessary items from the wasm-bindgen crate for Wasm interop.
- **const WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER_SIZE: usize = 2;**: Defines a constant for the buffer size (2 bytes).
- **static mut WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER: [u8; WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER_SIZE] = [0; WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER_SIZE];**: This is the crucial part. It declares a static mutable byte array named WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER.
  - **static**: This means the buffer has a static lifetime, existing for the entire duration of the Wasm module's execution.
  - **mut**: This makes the buffer mutable, meaning its contents can be changed.
  - **Crucially**: The combination of static and mut creates a global mutable variable, which is inherently unsafe in Rust due to the potential for data races if multiple parts of the code try to access and modify it concurrently. The comment acknowledges this.


```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn store_value_in_wasm_memory_buffer_index_zero(value: u8) {
    unsafe {
        WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER[0] = value;
    }
}
```
- **#[wasm_bindgen]**: This attribute makes the function accessible from JavaScript.
- **pub fn store_value_in_wasm_memory_buffer_index_zero(value: u8)**: This function takes a u8 (unsigned 8-bit integer) as input and stores it at index 0 of the WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER.
- **unsafe { WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER[0] = value; }**: The unsafe block is required because the code is accessing and modifying a static mut variable. This tells the Rust compiler that the programmer is taking responsibility for ensuring memory safety.


```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn get_wasm_memory_buffer_pointer() -> *const u8 {
    let pointer: *const u8;
    unsafe {
        pointer = WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER.as_ptr();
    }

    return pointer;
}
```

- **pub fn get_wasm_memory_buffer_pointer() -> *const u8**: This function returns a raw pointer (*const u8) to the beginning of the WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER. This pointer can then be passed to JavaScript, allowing JavaScript to directly access the Wasm memory.
- **unsafe { pointer = WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER.as_ptr(); }**: Again, the unsafe block is required because accessing the static mut variable is considered unsafe. as_ptr() gets a raw pointer to the start of the buffer.


```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn read_wasm_memory_buffer_and_return_index_one() -> u8 {
    let value: u8;
    unsafe {
        value = WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER[1];
    }
    return value;
}
```

- **pub fn read_wasm_memory_buffer_and_return_index_one() -> u8**: This function reads the value at index 1 of the WASM_MEMORY_BUFFER and returns it.
